# TensorFlow Transform [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/tensorflow-transform.svg?style=plastic)](https://github.com/tensorflow/transform)

**TensorFlow Transform** (**tf.Transform**) is a library for preprocessing
data with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org). tf.Transform is useful
for preprocessing that requires a full pass the data, such as:

* normalizing an input value by mean and stdev
* integerizing a vocabulary by looking at all input examples for values
* bucketizing inputs based on the observed data distribution

TensorFlow already supports arbitrary manipulations on a single example or
batch of examples. tf.Transform extends the capabilities to support full
passes over the example data.

The output of tf.Transform is exported as a TensorFlow graph for incorporation
into training and serving. Using the same graph for both training and
serving can prevent training/serving skew, because the same transforms are
performed in both scenarios.

**tf.Transform may introduce backwards incompatible changes before version
1.0**.

## Installation and Dependencies

The easiest and recommended way to install tf.Transform is with the PyPI
package.

`pip install tensorflow-transform`

Currently tf.Transform requires that TensorFlow be installed but does not have
an explicit dependency on TensorFlow as a package. See [TensorFlow
documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for more information on
installing TensorFlow.

tf.Transform requires Apache Beam to run distributed analysis. Apache Beam
runs in local mode by default, and can also run in distributed mode
using [Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/).
tf.Transform is designed to be extensible to other Apache Beam runners.
